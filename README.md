Developed a machine learning model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random
Forests to detect CKD. Applied data preprocessing techniques and leveraged XAI tools such as SHAP, LIME, and
ELI5 to interpret model predictions. Achieved high performance metrics and visualized results with confusion
matrices and ROC curves.
